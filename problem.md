##Overview

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, all room inspection in the Corps of Cadets is tracked by handwritten notes written on a printed inspection sheet in that specific room.
This becomes problematic because of the difficulty tracking this information throughout all levels of the chain of command. Additionally, while unlikely,
there is the possibility of dishonesty about failures. Cadets may make changes to the sheet or completely change the current inspection sheet so that
it appears as though they were not inspected or did not fail, allowing them to escape the consequences of failing room inspection.

**Attempted Solutions:**
One solution used in some cadet companies is marking failures outside of rooms so that the pass/fail status of their room inspection is more easily
visible to others. While this makes the information somewhat more accessible for others, the same concerns of altering the information exists. 
Therefore, this solution does not completely solve the issue.

Another attempted solution was passing along the information in group messages with the chain of command. This method limits the accesibility of the
information. Additionally, new messages for each failure is inefficient and provides information that may not be relevant to everyone.
This solution proved to be ineffective and failed to solve the problems.

**Proposal/Solution:**
We propose the development of an application that would be used to track inspections. Company leaders will be able to use this app to note the number
of gigs, types, and pass/fail status for a specific cadet/cadet room.
