##Overview

**Problem Statement:**
Cadet companies suffer regularly to acquire or maintain supplies at their unit level. Cadet supply officers are often limited in the resources that they
can access and, in many cases, are unable to receive them in a timely manner. This becomes extremely problematic as basic cleaning supplies and toiletries 
that are essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the barracks are scarce. This is a concern for basic health and quality of living. 

**Attempted Solutions:**
One solution used in some cadet companies is purchasing supplies on their own. In some companies, the supply officer, a firstie, takes the initiative
to go out of their way to travel to some supermarket to get the company's needed supplies. This is unfair to the supply officer and is usually not a
sustainable solution.

Another attempted solution was outsourcing through other supply officers. While this may provide a solution for the short term, maybe once every month,
this is also not sustainable. Additionally, the supply shortage affects many companies, if not all, across the Corps of Cadets. This corps-wide shortage
cannot be solved by simply taking from one to give to another. This only relocates the problem at hand and does not eliminate it.

**Proposal/Solution:**
We propose the development of an application that would be used to track supply levels in company. Our application would essentially be a running
inventory of all supplies. Supply officers at all levels would be able to more accurate maintain their inventory and be able to produce supply
requests in a timely manner by being able to actively maintain their inventory and observe the rate of use for each supply they possess.
